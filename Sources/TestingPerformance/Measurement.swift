extension TestingPerformance {
    /// Statistical performance measurement containing multiple duration samples.
    ///
    /// `Measurement` stores the results of running a performance test multiple times
    /// and provides statistical metrics like median, mean, percentiles, and standard deviation.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Create measurements using ``TestingPerformance/measure(warmup:iterations:operation:)-4kv1g``:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let (result, measurement) = TestingPerformance.measure(iterations: 100) {
    ///     expensiveOperation()
    /// }
    ///
    /// print("Median: \(measurement.median)")
    /// print("p95: \(measurement.p95)")
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Statistical Metrics
    ///
    /// - **Median** (``median``): Middle value, resistant to outliers
    /// - **Mean** (``mean``): Average of all measurements
    /// - **Percentiles** (``p50``, ``p75``, ``p90``, ``p95``, ``p99``, ``p999``): Values at specific percentiles
    /// - **Min/Max** (``min``, ``max``): Fastest and slowest iterations
    /// - **Standard Deviation** (``standardDeviation``): Measure of variation
    ///
    /// ## Comparison
    ///
    /// Measurements are `Comparable` by median value:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// if measurement1 < measurement2 {
    ///     print("measurement1 was faster")
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Serialization
    ///
    /// Measurements conform to `Codable` for easy serialization:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let encoder = JSONEncoder()
    /// encoder.outputFormatting = .prettyPrinted
    /// let data = try encoder.encode(measurement)
    /// ```
